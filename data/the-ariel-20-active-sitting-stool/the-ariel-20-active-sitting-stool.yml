name: The Ariel 2.0 Active Sitting Stool
description: The Ariel 2.0 by QOR360 is an active-sitting stool designed to
  reduce back pain and improve posture for people who sit at a computer all day.
  Its slightly rocking base keeps your pelvis and core engaged, encouraging
  continuous micro-movements instead of static sitting. Compared with the
  original Ariel 1.0, the 2.0 has a wider, more comfortable leather seat,
  greater stability (even with optional wheels), a higher 300‑pound weight
  capacity, and is comfortable enough for nearly a full workday. It has no
  armrests, offers tall (22–29 in) and short (17–22 in) height options, and
  comes with a lifetime warranty, making it a strong alternative or complement
  to traditional computer and gaming chairs for long sessions.
