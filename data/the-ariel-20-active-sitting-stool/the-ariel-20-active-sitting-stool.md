# The Ariel 2.0 Active Sitting Stool

## Overview
The Ariel 2.0 by QOR360 is an active-sitting stool designed for people who spend long periods at a computer. Its rocking, omni-directional base keeps the pelvis and core engaged, encouraging continuous micro-movements instead of static sitting. Compared with the original Ariel 1.0, it offers a wider and softer seat, greater stability, and a higher weight capacity, making it suitable for most of the workday as an alternative or complement to traditional office or gaming chairs.
