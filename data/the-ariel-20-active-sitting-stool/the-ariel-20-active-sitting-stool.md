# The Ariel 2.0 Active Sitting Stool

**Brand:** QOR360  
**Category:** Active sitting stool / chair accessory

The Ariel 2.0 is an active-sitting stool designed for people who sit at a computer for extended periods. Its rocking mechanism keeps the pelvis and core engaged, encouraging continuous micro-movements instead of static sitting. Compared with the Ariel 1.0, it offers a wider and softer seat, higher weight capacity, and greater stability for near full‑workday use.
