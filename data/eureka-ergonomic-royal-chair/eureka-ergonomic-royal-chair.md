# Eureka Ergonomic Royal Chair

**Name:** Eureka Ergonomic Royal Chair (Royal, Microfiber Leather Executive Office Chair)  
**Brand:** Eureka Ergonomic  
**Category:** Chair Accessories / Executive Office Chair  
**Model / SKU:** ERK-OC-003  
**Slug:** `eureka-ergonomic-royal-chair`

## Description
An executive-style, high-back computer/office chair upholstered in microfiber reinforced (faux) leather. It offers a plush, slightly bouncy seat and backrest with basic adjustability: a height-adjustable headrest, a multi-position recline, and fixed padded armrests. The compact seat frame can feel narrow for larger users, and lumbar support is limited, making it better suited to moderate rather than continuous all‑day use. The leather-like upholstery is easy to wipe clean but may feel warmer than mesh during extended sitting.

## Considerations
- Better suited for users who prioritize a plush, executive look and straightforward adjustments over highly configurable ergonomics.
- Fixed armrests and a relatively narrow seat may not fit larger users comfortably.
- Limited lumbar adjustability may be insufficient for people with back issues or for intensive all-day desk work.
- Leather-style upholstery is easy to clean but typically less ventilated than mesh, which some users may find warm over long sessions.
