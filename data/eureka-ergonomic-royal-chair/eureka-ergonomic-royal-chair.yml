name: Eureka Ergonomic Royal Chair
description: The Eureka Ergonomic Royal Chair is an executive-style computer
  chair designed for a plush, high-back aesthetic with faux leather upholstery.
  It offers a soft, slightly bouncy seat and back, quick setup, basic recline
  and headrest adjustment, and a compact seat framed by fixed armrests that may
  feel narrow for larger users. The solid build and easy-to-clean faux leather
  hold up reasonably well, but the non-breathable materials can trap heat and
  the limited lumbar support may be uncomfortable for prolonged all-day sitting.
  It comes with a relatively short two-year warranty, making it a mid-range
  option for users prioritizing appearance over advanced ergonomics.
