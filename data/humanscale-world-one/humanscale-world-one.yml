name: Humanscale World One
description: An all-mesh ergonomic task chair from Humanscale that relies on
  self-adjusting recline with minimal manual controls (primarily seat and
  armrest height). Intended as a lower-cost, lightweight office chair for
  all-day computer use, but this review notes plasticky build quality, limited
  comfort when reclining, and a fit that may suit shorter users better than
  taller ones.

  ## Overview
  Humanscale World One is an all‑mesh ergonomic task chair designed as a lower‑cost, lightweight option for daily office and computer work.

  ## Features

  - **Ergonomic task chair** intended for all‑day computer and office use.

  - **Positioning as a lower‑cost option** within Humanscale’s seating lineup.
  - **Fit characteristics (based on review notes):**
    - Likely more suitable for shorter users
    - Taller users may find the fit less supportive.
