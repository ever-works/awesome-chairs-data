name: Humanscale World One
description: An all-mesh ergonomic task chair from Humanscale that relies on
  self-adjusting recline with minimal manual controls (primarily seat and
  armrest height). Intended as a lower-cost, lightweight office chair for
  all-day computer use, but this review notes plasticky build quality, limited
  comfort when reclining, and a fit that may suit shorter users better than
  taller ones.
