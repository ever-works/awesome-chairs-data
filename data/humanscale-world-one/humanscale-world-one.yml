name: Humanscale World One
description: An all-mesh ergonomic task chair from Humanscale that relies on
  self-adjusting recline with minimal manual controls (primarily seat and
  armrest height). Intended as a lower-cost, lightweight office chair for
  all-day computer use, but this review notes plasticky build quality, limited
  comfort when reclining, and a fit that may suit shorter users better than
  taller ones.

  # Humanscale World One

  **Brand:** Humanscale  
  **Category:** Office / Task Chair

  ## Overview
  Humanscale World One is an all-mesh ergonomic task chair designed as a lighter, lower-cost option for all-day computer and office work. It uses a mostly self-adjusting recline mechanism with very few manual controls.

  ## Features
  - **All-mesh construction** for seat and back, intended for breathability during long work sessions.
  - **Self-adjusting recline** that automatically adapts to the user’s weight and posture with no tension knobs.
  - **Minimal manual controls** focused on:
    - Seat height adjustment
    - Armrest height adjustment
  - **Lightweight design** compared to many traditional task chairs.
  - **Intended use**: all-day computer and office work.

  ## Considerations / Limitations
  - Build quality is described as somewhat **plasticky** compared to higher-end chairs.
  - **Recline comfort is limited**, particularly when leaning back for extended periods.
  - The **fit may be better for shorter users** and less suitable for taller individuals.
