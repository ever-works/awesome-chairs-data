# Humanscale World One

**Brand:** Humanscale  
**Category:** Office / Task Chair

## Overview
Humanscale World One is an all-mesh ergonomic task chair designed as a lighter, lower-cost option for all-day computer and office work. It uses a mostly self-adjusting recline mechanism with very few manual controls.

## Features
- **All-mesh construction** for seat and back, intended for breathability during long work sessions.
- **Self-adjusting recline** that automatically adapts to the user’s weight and posture with no tension knobs.
- **Minimal manual controls** focused on:
  - Seat height adjustment
  - Armrest height adjustment
- **Lightweight design** compared to many traditional task chairs.
- **Intended use**: all-day computer and office work.

## Considerations / Limitations
- Build quality is described as somewhat **plasticky** compared to higher-end chairs.
- **Recline comfort is limited**, particularly when leaning back for extended periods.
- The **fit may be better for shorter users** and less suitable for taller individuals.
