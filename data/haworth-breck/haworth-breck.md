### Considerations

- Best suited for shorter users; taller individuals or those needing long seat depth may find it too compact.  
- Padding is intentionally thin; comfortable for many, but users preferring a very plush seat may want to note this.  
- Some users may find the gas lift and movement noise noticeable in very quiet environments.
