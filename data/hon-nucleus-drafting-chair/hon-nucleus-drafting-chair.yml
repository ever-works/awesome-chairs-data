name: Hon Nucleus Drafting Chair
description: A mid-range drafting chair designed for high desks and
  standing-height workstations. It offers a medium-firm seat, adjustable lumbar
  support, and armrests that move up/down and in/out. The model tested did not
  recline but allows seat height and depth adjustment, making it a functional
  option for extended computer work at elevated surfaces, though not regarded as
  best-in-class for the price.
