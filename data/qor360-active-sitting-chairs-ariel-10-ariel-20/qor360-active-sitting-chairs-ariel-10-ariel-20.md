## Overview

QOR360’s Ariel 1.0 and Ariel 2.0 are ergonomic “active sitting” office chairs designed for people who sit at a computer for long periods. Instead of holding you in a fixed position like traditional office or gaming chairs, they use a rocking base to encourage continuous, small movements while seated. The design is based on medical and posture research by Dr. Turner Osler, aiming to support healthier sitting and reduce back discomfort associated with prolonged static posture.

## Features

- **Active sitting design** – Replaces static sitting with continuous micro-movements to avoid remaining in one fixed posture for long periods.
- **Rocking base / RedRocker® mechanism**  
  - Patented RedRocker technology under the seat.  
  - Allows movement in all directions (multi‑directional rocking).  
  - Keeps the body subtly in motion instead of locked in place.
- **Ergonomic focus**  
  - Designed specifically for people who sit at a computer or desk all day.  
  - Intended as a healthier alternative to traditional office and gaming chairs used for long-duration sitting.
- **Posture support**  
  - Active sitting is described as helping to improve upright posture.  
  - Encourages a more aligned sitting position rather than slouching.
- **Core muscle engagement**  
  - The need to balance on the moving base promotes constant low-level use of core muscles.
- **Back-pain-oriented design**  
  - Chairs are designed to help reduce or prevent back pain associated with prolonged sitting by avoiding static positions.
- **Research- and physician-designed**  
  - Developed by Dr. Turner Osler, a physician and researcher, with a focus on long-term health effects of sitting.
- **Whole‑body movement emphasis**  
  - Promotes whole-body health by integrating gentle movement into otherwise sedentary work.
