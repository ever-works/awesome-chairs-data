## QOR360 Active Sitting Chairs (Ariel 1.0 & Ariel 2.0)

### Description
QOR360’s Ariel 1.0 and Ariel 2.0 are ergonomic “active sitting” office chairs designed for people who spend long periods at a computer. Instead of promoting a fixed posture, they use a rocking base to encourage continuous small movements while sitting. This approach aims to improve posture, engage core muscles, and help reduce back discomfort associated with prolonged, static sitting. They can be used as an alternative to traditional office and gaming chairs.

### Features
- **Active sitting design** – encourages ongoing micro‑movements rather than static sitting.
- **Rocking base** – seat rests on a rocking mechanism so the user can move subtly while seated.
- **RedRocker® Technology** – patented mechanism that allows the chair to move smoothly in all directions.
- **Full‑range motion** – supports multi‑directional movement (forward, backward, and side‑to‑side) while seated.
- **Posture support** – promotes a more upright, dynamic sitting posture.
- **Core engagement** – movement while sitting helps engage and strengthen core musculature over time.
- **Back‑health focus** – specifically designed as an option for people experiencing back pain from prolonged sitting.
- **For long‑duration computer use** – suitable for office, home office, and gaming setups where users sit for extended periods.
- **Research‑informed design** – developed by a physician (Dr. Turner Osler) with a focus on healthier sitting mechanics.
