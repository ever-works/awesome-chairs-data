  ## Overview
  The QOR360 Ariel 1.0 and Ariel 2.0 are ergonomic “active sitting” office chairs designed for people who sit at a computer for long periods. Instead of supporting a fixed posture, they use a rocking base to promote continuous micro‑movements, aiming to reduce back pain and support healthier sitting compared with traditional office or gaming chairs.

  ## Features
  - **Active sitting design** – Seat is intentionally unstable to encourage ongoing micro‑movements rather than static sitting.

  - **RedRocker® technology** – Uses QOR360’s patented RedRocker mechanism that allows movement in all directions.

  - **Ergonomic posture support** – Promotes a more upright, aligned posture during desk work.
  - **Core muscle engagement** – The unstable seat engages and strengthens core muscles while sitting.
  - **Back‑pain oriented design** – Developed specifically to help relieve or prevent back pain associated with prolonged sitting.
  - **MD-designed** – Created by Dr. Turner Osler, a physician and researcher focused on healthier sitting.
  - **Research‑backed concept** – Overall chair concept is informed by medical and biomechanical research around posture and movement.
  - **Whole‑body health focus** – Intended not just for comfort, but to support overall physical health during long sitting sessions.
  - **Suitable for long-duration computer use** – Aimed at office workers and others who sit at a computer most of the day.
