name: Knoll Newson
description: A minimalist, elastomer-mesh computer/task chair from Knoll
  designed for all-day desk use. It offers comfortable out-of-the-box support
  with basic adjustability, including recline tension via a red knob, and feels
  especially good when reclining. The mesh backrest can feel uneven depending on
  posture and it doesn’t support a very upright sitting position, but it is
  well-built and backed by a 12‑year warranty. Its high price keeps it out of
  some top-pick lists, yet it remains a premium option for computer work.
