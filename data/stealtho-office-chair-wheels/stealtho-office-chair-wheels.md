#Stealtho Office Chair Wheels

Replacement polyurethane office chair casters from Stealtho designed to fit most standard office chairs (excluding Ikea). The soft, rollerblade-style wheels roll smoothly and quietly while protecting hardwood floors from scratches and chips. They offer lower friction than typical plastic casters for easy gliding, and are available in both standard and locking versions if you want to prevent your chair from rolling away when you stand up.
