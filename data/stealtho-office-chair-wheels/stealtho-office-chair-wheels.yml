name: Stealtho Office Chair Wheels
description: Replacement polyurethane office chair casters from Stealtho
  designed to fit most standard office chairs (excluding Ikea). The soft,
  rollerblade-style wheels roll smoothly and quietly while protecting hardwood
  floors from scratches and chips. They offer lower friction than typical
  plastic casters for easy gliding, and are available in both standard and
  locking versions if you want to prevent your chair from rolling away when you
  stand up.
