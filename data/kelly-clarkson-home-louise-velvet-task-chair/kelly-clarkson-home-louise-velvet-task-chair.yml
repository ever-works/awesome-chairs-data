name: Kelly Clarkson Home Louise Velvet Task Chair
description: A stylish velvet task chair hand-picked by Kelly Clarkson for
  Wayfair, designed primarily for aesthetic appeal at a budget price. It
  provides a comfortable, durable velvet polyester seat and simple height
  adjustment but lacks other ergonomic adjustments. The compact, narrow frame
  works best for shorter or smaller users and can feel restrictive for broader
  shoulders. With a short 30‑day warranty and occasional finish chipping on the
  gold-colored frame, it’s suited more for light computer use where looks matter
  as much as function.
