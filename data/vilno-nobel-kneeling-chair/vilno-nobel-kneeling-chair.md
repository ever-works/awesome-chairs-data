#### Overview
The Vilno Nobel Kneeling Chair is an ergonomic, kneeling-style office chair designed to encourage a straighter posture and active sitting. Its rocking base promotes continuous micro-movements while you work, using a wooden frame and a thickly padded seat and knee cushion.

---

#### Features
- **Ergonomic kneeling design** to promote a more upright sitting posture compared to standard office chairs.
- **Active-sitting / rocking base** encourages continuous micro-movements instead of remaining completely static.
- **Wooden frame construction**, providing a solid structural base.
- **Thick seat cushion** for added comfort while seated.
- **Knee/shin support pad** to distribute weight between seat and lower legs.
- **Non-adjustable seat height**, making it best suited to standing desks or higher desktops where extra height is beneficial.
- **Compact footprint** compared to many conventional office chairs (based on typical kneeling-chair form factor).
- **Multiple color options visible in product imagery** (e.g., black, gray, green upholstery).

#### Usage Notes & Limitations
- Designed for **active sitting**, not for fully relaxed, reclined use.
- **Extended sessions may cause shin and knee fatigue**, especially for new users or without position changes.
- The **rocking base can shift on the floor**, so stable, non-slippery flooring or a mat may be helpful.
- Works best when **alternated with other sitting/standing positions** throughout the day.
