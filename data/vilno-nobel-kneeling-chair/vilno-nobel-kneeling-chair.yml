name: Vilno Nobel Kneeling Chair
description: An active kneeling-style computer chair designed to promote
  straighter posture and continuous micro-movement while sitting. It uses a
  wooden frame with a thick seat cushion and is best paired with a standing desk
  due to its non-adjustable height. While it encourages active sitting, extended
  use can cause shin and knee fatigue and the rocking base may cause the chair
  to shift on the floor.

  #### Overview
  The Vilno Nobel Kneeling Chair is an ergonomic, kneeling-style office chair designed to encourage a straighter posture and active sitting. Its rocking base promotes continuous micro-movements while you work, using a wooden frame and a thickly padded seat and knee cushion.

  ---

  #### Features
  - **Ergonomic kneeling design** to promote a more upright sitting posture compared to standard office chairs.
  - **Active-sitting / rocking base** encourages continuous micro-movements instead of remaining completely static.
  - **Wooden frame construction**, providing a solid structural base.
  - **Thick seat cushion** for added comfort while seated.
  - **Knee/shin support pad** to distribute weight between seat and lower legs.
  - **Non-adjustable seat height**, making it best suited to standing desks or higher desktops where extra height is beneficial.
  - **Compact footprint** compared to many conventional office chairs (based on typical kneeling-chair form factor).
  - **Multiple color options visible in product imagery** (e.g., black, gray, green upholstery).

  ---

  #### Usage Notes & Limitations
  - Designed for **active sitting**, not for fully relaxed, reclined use.
  - **Extended sessions may cause shin and knee fatigue**, especially for new users or without position changes.
  - The **rocking base can shift on the floor**, so stable, non-slippery flooring or a mat may be helpful.
  - Works best when **alternated with other sitting/standing positions** throughout the day.
