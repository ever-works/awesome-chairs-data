name: Vilno Nobel Kneeling Chair
description: An active kneeling-style computer chair designed to promote
  straighter posture and continuous micro-movement while sitting. It uses a
  wooden frame with a thick seat cushion and is best paired with a standing desk
  due to its non-adjustable height. While it encourages active sitting, extended
  use can cause shin and knee fatigue and the rocking base may cause the chair
  to shift on the floor.

  ### Description
  The Vilno Nobel Kneeling Chair is an ergonomic, active-sitting chair designed for computer and desk work. It positions the user in a kneeling posture to encourage a straighter spine and continuous micro-movements while seated. Built on a wooden frame with a thick seat cushion, it works especially well with standing desks but has a fixed, non-adjustable height.

  ### Features
  - **Ergonomic kneeling design** to promote a more upright posture compared with traditional office chairs.
  - **Active sitting/micro-movement**: rocking-style base encourages subtle movement while seated.
  - **Wooden frame** for a solid structural base.
  - **Thick seat cushion** for improved comfort during kneeling.
  - **Designed for computer and desk work**, particularly in home office or office setups.
  - **Best paired with standing desks** due to its fixed height.
  - **Non-adjustable height**: seat height cannot be raised or lowered.
  - **Rocking base** allows gentle forward/back movement.

  ### Considerations
  - Extended use may cause **shin and knee fatigue** for some users.
  - Rocking base may cause the chair to **shift or move on certain floor surfaces**.

  ### Ideal Use Cases
  - Users seeking **posture support** during desk work.  
  - Workstations with **standing desks** or higher desk surfaces.  
  - Those interested in **active sitting** alternatives to standard office chairs.
