name: Vilno Nobel Kneeling Chair
description: An active kneeling-style computer chair designed to promote
  straighter posture and continuous micro-movement while sitting. It uses a
  wooden frame with a thick seat cushion and is best paired with a standing desk
  due to its non-adjustable height. While it encourages active sitting, extended
  use can cause shin and knee fatigue and the rocking base may cause the chair
  to shift on the floor.
