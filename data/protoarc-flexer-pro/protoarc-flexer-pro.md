## Overview

Ergonomic mesh office chair designed for long computer sessions, with extensive adjustability (seat depth, multi-lock recline, forward tilt, and 4D/5D armrests). It uses firm, high-resilience foam and a breathable, washable mesh for durable support at a midrange price. The clip-on lumbar support can detach relatively easily.

## Features

### Ergonomic Adjustability
- **Multi-lock recline up to 125°** for varied sitting postures.  
- **Adjustable tilt tension** to match user body weight and task.  
- **Approx. 7 cm seat-depth adjustment** to accommodate different leg lengths and improve thigh support.  
- **Forward tilt (about 5°)** on the Flexer Pro model for a more active or task-focused posture.  
- **Upgraded 4D/5D armrests (Flexer Pro)** for a more precise arm fit (multi-directional adjustments).  
- **Multi-directional headrest** for head and neck positioning.  
- **Multiple recline angles** beyond upright, allowing position changes through the day.

### Support & Comfort
- **Dual-segment lumbar support** for targeted lower-back support.  
- **Firm seat foam** for consistent, structured support over long sessions.  
- **Ventilated cushion shell/base** with airflow channels to reduce heat and moisture buildup under the seat.  
- **Neutral-spine-oriented design**, combining headrest, lumbar segments, and recline to help maintain alignment during extended sitting.

### Materials & Breathability
- **FlexWeave™ mesh back and seat** made from **100% nylon mesh**.  
- **Breathable mesh structure** with optimized pore geometry to increase air circulation and help keep the user cooler.  
- **Waterproof, hydrophobic mesh** that resists liquid absorption.  
- **Rinse-clean surface**: everyday spills (e.g., coffee, milk) can be washed off directly.  
- **Single-layer woven backrest structure** balancing strength and breathability.  
- **55D high-resilience foam cushion** designed to maintain shape and resist sagging over time.

### Durability & Hardware
- **Durable mesh fabric** intended for daily use without rapid deformation.  
- **High-density (55D) seat foam** for long-term structural integrity.  
- **Class-4 gas lift**, commonly used for higher safety and durability standards in office chairs.  
- **Smooth, hair-resistant casters** to reduce tangling and make rolling easier.

### Model Distinctions (Flexer vs. Flexer Pro)
- Both Flexer and Flexer Pro:  
  - 125° multi-lock recline.  
  - 7 cm seat-depth adjustment.  
- Flexer Pro adds:  
  - Forward tilt (about 5°).  
  - Upgraded 4D/5D armrests.
