## Overview
The Zeph Stool is a height-adjustable version of the Zeph chair designed for sit-stand and drafting-height workstations. It combines a classic shell-chair silhouette with a modern ergonomic mechanism that allows the stool to move naturally with the user while sitting or perching.

## Features
- **Ergonomic kinematic monoshell**  
  - One-piece (monoshell) seat-and-back design engineered to move with the user.  
  - Recline motion is tuned so the body’s natural pivot points create the counterbalance, promoting a supported, ergonomic sitting experience.  
  - Designed to keep the user feeling supported as they shift posture and move through the day.

- **Height-adjustable stool**  
  - Drafting / stool-height base suitable for sit-stand desks and higher work surfaces.  
  - Supports both seated and perching postures.

- **Optional 3D Knit seat insert**  
  - Removable and interchangeable 3D Knit cover that slides directly into the shell.  
  - Tool-free installation and removal.  
  - Can be swapped out to change color or refresh the stool over time.  
  - Available in a range of textile color options (20 color choices indicated).  

- **Material efficiency and sustainability (3D Knit)**  
  - 3D Knit is made from 50% post-consumer recycled content.  
  - Knitted to the exact dimensions of the shell to eliminate fabric cutting waste (zero fabric waste in the cover’s production).

- **Design & aesthetics**  
  - Classic shell-chair profile influenced by mid-century modern forms.  
  - Contemporary ergonomic engineering integrated into a visually simple form.  
  - Reduced number of components compared to more complex task chairs, for a cleaner look.
