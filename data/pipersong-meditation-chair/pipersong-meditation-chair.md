The Pipersong Meditation Chair is an ergonomic, non-traditional computer and desk chair designed for people who prefer or frequently shift into alternative sitting positions, such as cross-legged, kneeling, squatting, or sitting with one leg up. It supports active sitting and regular posture changes during long hours at a desk, and can also function as a standard chair when needed.
