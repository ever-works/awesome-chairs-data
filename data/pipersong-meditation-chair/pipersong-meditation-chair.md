# Pipersong Meditation Chair

## Overview
The Pipersong Meditation Chair is an ergonomic, non-traditional computer/desk chair designed for people who prefer or require alternative sitting positions over long periods. It includes a 360° swiveling footstool and can be used both for unconventional sitting (e.g., cross-legged) and as a standard office chair.

## Features
- **Non-traditional ergonomic design** tailored for users who sit for long hours in alternative positions.

  - Cross-legged sitting
  - Squatting
  - Kneeling
  - One leg up
  - Standard/feet-flat sitting
  - Other “creative” or mixed positions
- **Encourages frequent posture changes** while working at a desk, allowing users to shift positions throughout the day.
- **Active, flexible seating** that facilitates continuous small movements rather than fixed, rigid postures.
- **Adjustable armrests** (armchair configuration) for forearm support during typing or reading.
- **Back cushion/backrest** for lumbar and back support.
- **Convertible to a regular chair** by tucking the footstool behind and placing feet flat on the floor.
