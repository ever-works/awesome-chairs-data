# TopJob Napa Chair

## Overview
The TopJob Napa Chair (also called the Napa Ergonomic Chair) is an office and computer chair with a strong emphasis on visual style: amber vegan leather options and a minimalist five-wheel base. It offers a reclining back, adjustable armrests, an integrated headrest, and a pull-out footrest. Cushioning is relatively firm, ergonomic adjustment options are limited compared with more advanced task chairs, and the overall build may feel less premium than expected at this price, making it better suited for style-conscious setups than intensive all-day use.

  - Adjustable **tilt tension** to match user weight and preference
  - Limited locking positions (not a fully multi-lock system)

  - Available in **premium eco-friendly (vegan) leather** and select liquid-resistant fabric options (bouclé or linen, depending on variant)
