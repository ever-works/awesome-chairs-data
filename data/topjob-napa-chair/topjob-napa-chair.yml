name: TopJob Napa Chair
description: The TopJob Napa is an office and computer chair with adjustable
  armrest height, limited recline locking, and tilt tension, plus a pull-out
  footrest and headrest. It features amber vegan leather upholstery and a
  minimalist five-wheel base design, but offers relatively firm cushioning, few
  ergonomic adjustments, and build quality that may feel cheap for its price
  point, making it more of a style-focused than a top-tier all-day comfort
  chair.

  # TopJob Napa Chair


  ## Overview

  The TopJob Napa Chair (also called the Napa Ergonomic Chair) is an office and
  computer chair with a strong emphasis on visual style: amber vegan leather
  options and a minimalist five-wheel base. It offers a reclining back,
  adjustable armrests, an integrated headrest, and a pull-out footrest.
  Cushioning is relatively firm, ergonomic adjustment options are limited
  compared with more advanced task chairs, and the overall build may feel less
  premium than expected at this price, making it better suited for
  style-conscious setups than intensive all-day use.


  ## Features

  - **Recline & Tilt**
    - Backrest reclines up to **135°**
    - Adjustable **tilt tension** to match user weight and preference
    - Limited locking positions (not a fully multi-lock system)

  - **Seat & Comfort**
    - Firm, high-density foam seat cushion
    - Designed for short-to-moderate duration use rather than maximum all-day plush comfort

  - **Armrests**
    - **Height-adjustable (2D) armrests**
    - Designed to support forearms at different desk heights

  - **Headrest**
    - Integrated **adjustable headrest** included with every chair

  - **Footrest**
    - **Pull-out, adjustable footrest** built into the chair
    - Can support stretched legs, semi-reclined positions, or cross-legged seating

  - **Upholstery & Look**
    - Available in **premium eco-friendly (vegan) leather** and select liquid-resistant fabric options (bouclé or linen, depending on variant)
    - Amber / cream-toned finishes support a warm, minimalist aesthetic
    - Minimalist **five-wheel base** design

  - **Ergonomics & Adjustability (Overall)**
    - Height-adjustable seat and armrests
    - Reclining back with tilt tension control
    - Adjustable headrest and footrest
