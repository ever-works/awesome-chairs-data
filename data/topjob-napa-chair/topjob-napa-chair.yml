name: TopJob Napa Chair
description: The TopJob Napa is an office and computer chair with adjustable
  armrest height, limited recline locking, and tilt tension, plus a pull-out
  footrest and headrest. It features amber vegan leather upholstery and a
  minimalist five-wheel base design, but offers relatively firm cushioning, few
  ergonomic adjustments, and build quality that may feel cheap for its price
  point, making it more of a style-focused than a top-tier all-day comfort
  chair.

  ## Overview
  The TopJob Napa Chair is a style-forward office/computer chair that combines a high back with a pull-out footrest and headrest. It offers basic ergonomic adjustments, a firm sitting feel, and amber vegan leather upholstery on a minimalist five-wheel base.

  ## Features
  - **Adjustable armrests:** Height-adjustable armrest design.  
  - **Recline function:** Backrest recline with **limited recline locking** positions.  
  - **Tilt tension control:** Adjustable tilt tension to change how easily the chair leans back.  
  - **Pull-out footrest:** Integrated leg/footrest that extends from under the seat.  
  - **Headrest:** Built‑in headrest for upper‑back and neck support.  
  - **High-back design:** Tall backrest for more upper‑body coverage.  
  - **Upholstery:** Amber **vegan leather** finish.  
  - **Base:** Minimalist **five‑wheel** rolling base.  
  - **Cushioning:** Relatively **firm padding**, less plush than some all‑day ergonomic chairs.  
  - **Ergonomic adjustability:** Only a **few ergonomic adjustments** beyond arm height, recline lock, and tilt tension.  
  - **Build and feel:** Overall build quality may feel **less premium** compared with some chairs in a similar price range.  
  - **Design focus:** Emphasis on a **stylish, modern aesthetic** rather than maximum, fully adjustable all‑day comfort.

  ## Pros
  - Pull‑out footrest and headrest for semi‑reclined work or rest.  
  - Height‑adjustable armrests.  
  - Vegan leather finish for a sleek, non‑fabric look.  
  - Simple five‑wheel base for easy movement.

  ## Considerations / Limitations
  - Firm cushioning may not suit users who prefer soft, plush seating.  
  - Limited ergonomic adjustments compared with high‑end ergonomic chairs.  
  - Perceived build quality may feel basic for the expected price bracket.  
  - Better suited to style‑conscious setups than to users needing intensive, all‑day ergonomic tuning.
