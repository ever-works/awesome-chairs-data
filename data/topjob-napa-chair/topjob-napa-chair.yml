name: TopJob Napa Chair
description: The TopJob Napa is an office and computer chair with adjustable
  armrest height, limited recline locking, and tilt tension, plus a pull-out
  footrest and headrest. It features amber vegan leather upholstery and a
  minimalist five-wheel base design, but offers relatively firm cushioning, few
  ergonomic adjustments, and build quality that may feel cheap for its price
  point, making it more of a style-focused than a top-tier all-day comfort
  chair.
