name: AKRacing Core EX
description: The AKRacing Core EX is a high-quality, ergonomic gaming and
  computer chair designed for people who sit for extended periods. It features a
  reclining backrest suitable for both gaming and relaxed viewing, highly
  adjustable armrests (height, depth, pivot, and lateral adjustment via bottom
  bolts), and a fabric upholstery on the baseline model that is durable and easy
  to clean, though warmer than PU/PVC leather. AKRacing also offers the Core EX
  with more breathable PU leather options and provides an online sizing chart to
  help users match the chair to their body type, making it well-suited for
  all-day computer and gaming use.
