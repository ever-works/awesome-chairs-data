  ## Features


  ### Ergonomics & Support

  - **High-back ergonomic profile** for full back and shoulder support.

  - **Customizable integrated lumbar support** with vertical (up/down)
  adjustment to align with the spine’s natural curve.

  - **Tailored round-edge seat cushion design**:
    - Rounded seat-front and edges instead of sharp corners.

    - Provides a wider seating area to support varied sitting postures.
  - **Integrated soft leg rest**:
    - Built-in extendable leg rest to support the thighs and lower legs.
    - Intended to reduce pressure on the legs during recline.

  ### Recline, Tilt & Rocking

  recline) for working, casual use, or resting.

  - **Enhanced tilt mechanism**:
    - Allows **up to 15° rocking** when unlocked.
    - Can be locked in a tilted-back position.
    - Designed for stable, smooth tilt without wobble.

  ### Armrests

  - **Aluminum-constructed 4D armrests**:
    - Internal structure made from **high-grade aluminum alloy** for increased durability and smoother adjustment.
    - 4D adjustability (height, depth, width, and pivot/angle – implied by “4D”).
    - Redesigned arm pads/pods with a softer top surface for forearm and elbow comfort.

  ### Materials & Upholstery Options

  setups.
