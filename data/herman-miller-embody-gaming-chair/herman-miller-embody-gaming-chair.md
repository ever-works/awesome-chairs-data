  - Supports the sacrum (base of the spine) to mimic a strong, upright standing posture while seated.
  - Provides integrated lumbar support to help keep the chest open and pelvis slightly forward.
- **BackFit adjustment**:
  - Adjusts to the unique curvature of your spine.
  - Helps maintain a neutral, balanced posture and combat the tendency of the spine to slump over time.
- **Even pressure distribution**:
  - Seat and back automatically conform to your movements.
  - Distributes body weight evenly to reduce pressure build-up and support blood flow.
- **Active-sitting support**: Frame, foam, and fabric system are designed to support frequent posture shifts while remaining supported.
