  ### Herman Miller Embody Gaming Chair


  **Category:** Gaming Chair  

  **Brand:** Herman Miller


  #### Description

  A gaming-focused variant of the Herman Miller Embody chair, designed for long
  PC and console gaming sessions. It keeps the original Embody’s ergonomic frame
  and adjustability while adding materials and foam layers tailored for more
  active, upright gaming postures and improved heat management.


  #### Features

  - **Ergonomic design developed with clinical input**
    - Originally developed with input from more than 30 physicians and PhDs in biomechanics, vision, physical therapy, and ergonomics.
    - Further refined for gaming in partnership with Logitech G.

  - **Enhanced gaming seat construction**
    - Additional foam layer in the seat to support a more upright, active gaming posture.
    - Composite cooling foam technology in the seat to reduce heat build-up during long sessions.
    - Copper‑infused foam layer (from product spec) aimed at improving heat dissipation and comfort over extended use.

  - **Posture and spinal support**
    - **PostureFit spinal support** mimics the posture of standing by supporting the sacrum and providing lumbar support, encouraging an open chest and slight forward pelvic tilt.
    - **BackFit adjustment** allows the backrest to adjust to the user’s unique spinal shape, helping maintain a neutral, balanced posture and reducing the tendency of the spine to curve uncomfortably over time.
    - Targeted pressure distribution in seat and back automatically conforms to body movements, distributes weight evenly, and is intended to support blood flow during extended sitting.

  - **Seat and backrest construction**
    - Seat built with two spring layers, one mat layer, and one foam layer topped with Sync fabric for responsive support.
    - Backrest uses a translucent flexible polymer attached to an acetal H-flexor back structure to allow dynamic support and movement.

  - **Adjustability**
    - **Armrests**
      - Adjustable arm height: raise for forearm support or lower to fit under desks.
      - Adjustable arm width: move arms inward for closer support or outward to clear space.
    - **BackFit adjustment**
      - Backrest tension/shape tuning via a rear BackFit knob, so the chair aligns to the spine and head position relative to the monitor.
    - **Seat depth adjustment**
      - Seat can slide forward or backward to reduce pressure on the legs and allow coordinated movement with the backrest.
    - **Seat height adjustment**
      - Height can be raised or lowered so feet rest flat on the floor for stable, anchored posture while gaming.

  - **Materials and durability**
    - **Upholstery**: 100% polyester, tested for:
      - Abrasion durability
      - Seam strength
      - UV light resistance
      - Colour retention (crocking resistance)
      - Flame resistance
    - **Frame and structural elements**:
      - Texture powder coat on die-cast aluminum components.
      - Self-skinning thermo-plastic urethane (TPU) foam molded around a glass-filled nylon insert for durable, shaped support.
      - Acetal H-flexor back structure with translucent flexible polymer panels.
    - **Casters**:
      - 63.5 mm diameter double-wheel casters.
      - Black nylon hubs with soft polyurethane tread for smoother rolling and floor protection.
