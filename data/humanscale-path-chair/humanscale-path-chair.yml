name: Humanscale Path Chair
description: "The Humanscale Path is a compact, ergonomic computer and office
  chair designed for tight workspaces and shared home offices. Measuring only 20
  inches wide by 21 inches deep, it offers a minimalist profile with optional
  tiny arms or a fully armless configuration, making it easier to fit in small
  nooks or close desk setups. Built with Humanscale’s ergonomic reclining
  mechanism and a supportive seat cylinder, the Path emphasizes comfort for
  all‑day sitting while incorporating sustainability: each chair includes about
  22 pounds of recycled materials (including ocean plastics) and can be
  upholstered in FormSense Eco Knit, a 100% post‑consumer recycled polyester
  textile that is cool, comfortable, and easy to clean."
