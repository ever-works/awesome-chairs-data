#Hon Altern Chair

An affordable ergonomic office chair option under $300 with a wide, soft seat and seat depth adjustment that fits a broad range of body types. It includes a headrest by default and provides basic comfort for all‑day computer use, though its back support is more reclined and the armrests are limited to up‑and‑down adjustment.
