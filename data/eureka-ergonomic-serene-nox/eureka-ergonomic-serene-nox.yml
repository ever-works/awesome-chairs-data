  ## Eureka Ergonomic Serene Nox


  **Category:** Ergonomic office chair  

  **Brand:** Eureka Ergonomic


  ### Overview

  The Eureka Ergonomic Serene Nox is a leather office and computer chair with a
  visually distinctive, high-back design. While it offers reasonable comfort for
  shorter sessions, there are reports of structural problems over time,
  particularly with the frame and seat height stability. This makes it a
  questionable option for people who sit for many hours a day, especially given
  its premium price positioning.


  ### Features

  - Leather office and computer chair

  - High-back design for upper-back and shoulder coverage

  - Ergonomic styling intended for desk and computer use

  - Designed as a premium, higher-priced chair compared with typical office
  seating


  ### Pros

  - Attractive, modern silhouette

  - Decent comfort for short to moderate sitting sessions


  ### Cons

  - Reported structural issues with the frame over time

  - Screws can loosen, causing the seat to drop

  - Not recommended for all-day or heavy daily use

  - Premium price is difficult to justify given durability concerns


  ### Pricing

  - Marketed as a **premium-priced** office chair.  

  - Exact pricing and any variations are not specified in the provided content
  and may vary by retailer or promotion.
