## Eureka Ergonomic Serene Nox

**Category:** Ergonomic office chair  
**Brand:** Eureka Ergonomic

### Overview
The Eureka Ergonomic Serene Nox is a leather office and computer chair with a visually distinctive, high-back design. While it offers reasonable comfort for shorter sessions, there are reports of structural problems over time, particularly with the frame and seat height stability. This makes it a questionable option for people who sit for many hours a day, especially given its premium price positioning.
