## Overview
The Eureka Ergonomic Serene Nox is a leather office and computer chair with a visually attractive, high-back silhouette and generally decent comfort. However, there are notable reports of structural issues over time—specifically frame screws loosening and the seat height dropping—which makes it a questionable option for users who sit for long periods, especially given its premium pricing tier.

## Features
- **Design & Style**
  - High-back profile for a more immersive, enveloping seating feel
  - Sleek, stylish silhouette intended to complement modern workspaces
  - Leather finish for a more premium, executive-style appearance

- **Use Case**
  - Designed as an office and computer chair for desk work
  - Better suited to light or moderate daily use rather than all-day sitting

- **Comfort**
  - Described as offering decent day-to-day comfort
  - Padding and support are adequate for shorter to medium-length sessions

- **Construction & Durability (Reported Issues)**
  - Users have reported frame screws loosening over time
  - Seat height reportedly drops over continued use as the structure loosens
  - These issues can affect both comfort and long-term usability

## Known Limitations
- Not recommended for users who sit all day due to durability concerns
- Structural issues (loosening screws, seat droop) can emerge with extended use
- Considered a poor overall value for heavy users given its premium price positioning

## Pricing
- **Pricing information:** Not specified on the provided source content.
