# Herman Miller Aeron Stool

The Herman Miller Aeron Stool is a high-height adaptation of the Aeron chair for sit-stand desks and counter-height workstations. It uses the same 8Z Pellicle mesh seat and back for breathable, zoned support and includes ergonomic adjustments similar to the standard Aeron while adding an extended cylinder and foot ring. It’s suitable for users who alternate between sitting and standing but still need ergonomic support for long computer work sessions.
