name: Herman Miller Aeron Stool
description: The Herman Miller Aeron Stool is a high-height adaptation of the
  Aeron chair for sit-stand desks and counter-height workstations. It uses the
  same 8Z Pellicle mesh seat and back for breathable, zoned support and includes
  ergonomic adjustments similar to the standard Aeron while adding an extended
  cylinder and foot ring. It’s suitable for users who alternate between sitting
  and standing but still need ergonomic support for long computer work sessions.
